Most settings of the aimbot are configured on lbox menu (ignore cloaked, bonked, aim fov, aim key, etc)

This is not a fork anymore

If LMAOBOX's projectile aimbot is enabled, this script will be disabled when using a projectile weapon :) (we dont need 2 aimbots running at the same time, do we?)

### Features
- Options on the lbox menu that affect the script:
   - aim key
   - aim fov
   - auto shoot
   - ignore cloaked
   - ignore bonked
   - ignore taunting
   - ignore disguised
